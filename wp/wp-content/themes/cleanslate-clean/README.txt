This themes is base on the HTML5 Reset wordpress theme.
Instead of resets, we normalize css.
There are some useful functions in functions.php and some useless ones.
Theme comes with theme options framework.
If you don't need a lot of crazy options just delete it.

I chose the HTML5 reset theme as a base because the template files are minimal.
