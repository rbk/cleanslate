Cleanslate is a base wordpress install and theme that we use as the basis for most of our websites.
It handles some basic stuff for us and has many features that we use regularly. It is meant to be
used frequently and modified as necessary when we find better ways of doing things.

Some features it provides:

* Cleanslate theme based on HTML5 boilerplate, which is more-or-less unstyled but includes some basic compass-based stylesheets which are assembled in a mobile-first fashion. In other words, the basic application.scss has the basic styling at the top, as you would like the site to work on a mobile device, and then has a media query for device width > 550px, which is where most of our styles would go. Since this approach has evolved over time, these stylesheets are not necessarily set up perfectly, so please keep the spirit in mind but build your stylesheets as you see fit. If you improve upon what's there, please consider incorporating those improvements back into this git repo.
* Prevents the "just another wordpress site" BS that was easy to miss until a site went live.
* New Post Type and Mailchimp widget plugins that we use frequently
* Rotator javascript. Works, but needs to be updated or replaced with something better.
* and more!
